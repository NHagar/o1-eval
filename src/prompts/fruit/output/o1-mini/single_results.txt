Certainly! Below is a Python script that generates a scatter plot showing the relationship between **Retail Price** and **Cup Equivalent Price** of fruits. The plot includes a line of best fit to illustrate the trend in the data.

### Python Script

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load the data from the CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('./data/fruit_prices.csv')

# Extract the relevant columns
retail_price = data['RetailPrice']
cup_equivalent_price = data['CupEquivalentPrice']

# Calculate the line of best fit
slope, intercept = np.polyfit(retail_price, cup_equivalent_price, 1)
best_fit_line = slope * retail_price + intercept

# Create the scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(retail_price, cup_equivalent_price, color='blue', label='Data Points')

# Plot the line of best fit
plt.plot(retail_price, best_fit_line, color='red', label='Best Fit Line')

# Add title and labels
plt.title('Relationship between Retail Price and Cup Equivalent Price of Fruits')
plt.xlabel('Retail Price (per unit)')
plt.ylabel('Cup Equivalent Price')

# Add a legend
plt.legend()

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

### Brief Description of the Figure

The generated figure is a scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between the **Retail Price** and the **Cup Equivalent Price** of various fruits. Each blue dot represents a data point corresponding to a specific fruit entry from the dataset. The red line overlaying the scatter plot is the line of best fit, which indicates the overall trend between the two variables. The title clearly states the nature of the relationship being examined, and the axes are labeled for clarity. This visualization helps in understanding how changes in the retail price of fruits are associated with their cup equivalent prices.
