```python

# Read the data
df = pd.read_csv('./data/fruit_prices.csv', index_col=0)

# Remove rows with missing data in the relevant columns
df = df.dropna(subset=['RetailPrice', 'CupEquivalentPrice'])

# Create the scatter plot with regression line
sns.set(style='whitegrid')
g = sns.lmplot(x='RetailPrice', y='CupEquivalentPrice', data=df, aspect=1.5)

# Set axis labels and title
g.set_axis_labels('Retail Price ($ per unit)', 'Cup Equivalent Price ($ per cup)')

**Figure Description:**

The figure displays a scatter plot illustrating the relationship between the retail price and cup equivalent price of various fruit products. Each point represents a fruit item from the dataset. A line of best fit is included to highlight the trend, showing that generally, as the retail price increases, the cup equivalent price also tends to increase. This suggests a positive correlation between the two pricing measures for fruits.
