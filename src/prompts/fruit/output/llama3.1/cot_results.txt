To generate the figure that shows the relationship between retail price and cup equivalent price, I will follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for creating plots.

2. Load the data from the fruit_prices.csv file into a DataFrame using pandas' read_csv function.

3. Extract the RetailPrice and CupEquivalentPrice columns from the DataFrame.

4. Create a scatter plot of the RetailPrice and CupEquivalentPrice columns using matplotlib's scatter function.

5. Calculate a line of best fit for the data using numpy's polyfit function to find the coefficients of the polynomial that best fits the data, then use these coefficients to create a line that spans the range of x values in the scatter plot.

6. Add a title to the figure that describes the relationship between retail price and cup equivalent price.

7. Display the figure using matplotlib's show function.

<reflection>
I need to adjust my thinking process by considering potential issues, such as:
- Handling missing or invalid data
- Selecting an appropriate model for the line of best fit (e.g., linear, polynomial)
- Choosing a suitable color scheme and label styling for the plot

</reflection>
<thinking>
Considering these factors, I will adjust my approach to include the following steps:

1. Before plotting, ensure that there are no missing or invalid values in the RetailPrice and CupEquivalentPrice columns.

2. Use numpy's polyfit function with a degree of 1 to fit a linear line of best fit to the data.

3. Add labels to the axes, title, and legend for clarity.

<output>
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load the data from the fruit_prices.csv file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('./data/fruit_prices.csv')

# Extract the RetailPrice and CupEquivalentPrice columns from the DataFrame
retail_price = df['RetailPrice']
cup_equivalent_price = df['CupEquivalentPrice']

# Ensure there are no missing or invalid values in the RetailPrice and CupEquivalentPrice columns
if retail_price.isnull().values.any() or cup_equivalent_price.isnull().values.any():
    print("Warning: There are missing or invalid values in the data.")
else:
    # Create a scatter plot of the RetailPrice and CupEquivalentPrice columns
    plt.scatter(retail_price, cup_equivalent_price)

    # Calculate a line of best fit for the data (linear)
    z = np.polyfit(retail_price, cup_equivalent_price, 1)
    p = np.poly1d(z)
    
    # Use the coefficients to create a line that spans the range of x values in the scatter plot
    xp = np.linspace(min(retail_price), max(retail_price), 100)
    yp = p(xp)

    plt.plot(xp, yp, "r--")

    # Add labels to the axes and title for clarity
    plt.xlabel('Retail Price')
    plt.ylabel('Cup Equivalent Price')
    plt.title('Relationship between Retail Price and Cup Equivalent Price')

    # Display the figure
    plt.show()
```
This code will generate a scatter plot of the retail price vs cup equivalent price with a line of best fit (linear) added to the plot. The relationship between the two variables is described by the title.
