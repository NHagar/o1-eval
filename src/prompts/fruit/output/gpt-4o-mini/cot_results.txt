To create the desired figure, I need to use a plotting library like Matplotlib or Seaborn in Python. The first step is to read the data from the CSV file and extract the relevant columns: 'RetailPrice' and 'CupEquivalentPrice'. Next, I will plot a scatter plot using this data.

After plotting the scatter plot, I will add a line of best fit. This can be achieved using NumPy's `polyfit` to compute the coefficients for a linear fit, which will allow me to plot the line on the scatter plot.

Finally, I will add a title that clearly describes the relationship between 'RetailPrice' and 'CupEquivalentPrice'. 

In summary, the steps are:
1. Load the data from `fruit_prices.csv`.
2. Create a scatter plot with 'RetailPrice' on the x-axis and 'CupEquivalentPrice' on the y-axis.
3. Compute and plot the line of best fit.
4. Add an appropriate title to the plot.

To ensure the script works correctly, I'll check for any discrepancies in data loading and plotting commands.

Next, I will write the Python script to accomplish this.

The Python script will look something like this:
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('./data/fruit_prices.csv')

# Extract relevant columns
x = data['RetailPrice']
y = data['CupEquivalentPrice']

# Create a scatter plot
plt.scatter(x, y, color='blue', label='Data points')

# Calculate line of best fit
m, b = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)
plt.plot(x, m*x + b, color='red', label='Line of Best Fit')

# Add title and labels
plt.title('Relationship Between Retail Price and Cup Equivalent Price')
plt.xlabel('Retail Price ($)')
plt.ylabel('Cup Equivalent Price ($)')

# Show legend
plt.legend()

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```
Additionally, the figure created by this script will illustrate the relationship between retail price and cup equivalent price, showing how price per pound correlates to price per cup.

Now, I will ensure that this aligns correctly with the task requirements and that the code is effective.

<reflection>
The plan for creating the figure seems well-structured, and I've included all necessary components. The step-by-step reasoning covers data loading, plotting, and adding the line of best fit correctly. Upon reviewing the code, I have ensured to customize the labels and titles appropriately, and consider adding legends to differentiate between the data points and the line of best fit.

One minor adjustment is that I should ensure to check the dependencies for running the code, such as making sure `Matplotlib`, `NumPy`, and `Pandas` are installed. Additionally, I may want to specify the default size for the plot to ensure clarity in presentation.

Overall, my initial thought process appears robust, and the script should function as intended.

I will finalize the output by confirming everything is ready for presentation. I will include the finalized script with slight improvements (specifying the figure size) and provide a concise description of the figure. Here's the adjusted script with plot size and a clear description of what the figure represents.

The output script is:
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('./data/fruit_prices.csv')

# Extract relevant columns
x = data['RetailPrice']
y = data['CupEquivalentPrice']

# Create a scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))  # Specify figure size
plt.scatter(x, y, color='blue', label='Data points')

# Calculate line of best fit
m, b = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)
plt.plot(x, m*x + b, color='red', label='Line of Best Fit')

# Add title and labels
plt.title('Relationship Between Retail Price and Cup Equivalent Price')
plt.xlabel('Retail Price ($)')
plt.ylabel('Cup Equivalent Price ($)')

# Show legend
plt.legend()

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

The figure produced by this script will show a scatter plot representing the relationship between the retail prices of various fruits and their cup equivalent prices, along with a red line indicating the line of best fit, visually depicting how the two metrics correlate.

<output>
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('./data/fruit_prices.csv')

# Extract relevant columns
x = data['RetailPrice']
y = data['CupEquivalentPrice']

# Create a scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))  # Specify figure size
plt.scatter(x, y, color='blue', label='Data points')

# Calculate line of best fit
m, b = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)
plt.plot(x, m*x + b, color='red', label='Line of Best Fit')

# Add title and labels
plt.title('Relationship Between Retail Price and Cup Equivalent Price')
plt.xlabel('Retail Price ($)')
plt.ylabel('Cup Equivalent Price ($)')

# Show legend
plt.legend()

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

The figure generated by this script will display a scatter plot of retail prices against cup equivalent prices, with a line of best fit that helps visualize the linear relationship between these two variables.
