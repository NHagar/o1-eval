To create the figure you described, we will use Python along with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The script will read the data from the CSV file, generate a scatter plot of the `RetailPrice` versus `CupEquivalentPrice`, and include a line of best fit. Below is the Python script to accomplish this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('./data/fruit_prices.csv')

# Set the theme for seaborn
sns.set_theme()

# Create a scatter plot with a line of best fit
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.regplot(x='RetailPrice', y='CupEquivalentPrice', data=data, scatter_kws={'alpha':0.6})

# Add title and labels
plt.title('Relationship between Retail Price and Cup Equivalent Price')
plt.xlabel('Retail Price (per unit)')
plt.ylabel('Cup Equivalent Price (per cup)')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

### Description of the figure:

The figure is a scatter plot depicting the relationship between the `RetailPrice` and `CupEquivalentPrice` for various fruits and forms as observed in the dataset. Each point on the scatter plot represents a specific data entry with its retail price and corresponding cup equivalent price. A line of best fit is drawn over the data points to indicate the general trend between the two variables.

This graphical representation helps visualize how the retail price per unit correlates with the cup equivalent price. The line of best fit provides an approximation of the linear relationship, if any, between retail price and cup equivalent price.
