A description summarizes the insights observed from the figure.\n\n### Python Script:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the data from CSV\nfile_path = './data/fruit_prices.csv'\ndata = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n\n# Create the scatter plot with line of best fit\nsns.lmplot(x='RetailPrice', y='CupEquivalentPrice', data=data, height=6, aspect=1.5)\n\n# Add a title\nplt.title('Relationship between Retail Price and Cup Equivalent Price')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Description:\nThe figure generated by the script provides a scatter plot illustrating the relationship between `RetailPrice` and `CupEquivalentPrice`. Each point represents a distinct fruit product, with the red line indicating a line of best fit. The plot suggests a generally increasing relationship between the two prices, indicating that higher retail prices may correspond with higher cup-equivalent prices.",
