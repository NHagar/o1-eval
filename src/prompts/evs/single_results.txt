To create a figure that shows the distribution of electric vehicle range for each electric vehicle type, we can use the `matplotlib` and `pandas` libraries for data manipulation and visualization. Below is the Python script that accomplishes this task.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('./data/evs.csv')

# Create a figure with subplots for each Electric Vehicle Type
ev_types = data['Electric Vehicle Type'].unique()
n_ev_types = len(ev_types)

# Set up the plot with one subplot for each electric vehicle type
fig, axes = plt.subplots(n_ev_types, figsize=(10, 5 * n_ev_types), sharex=True, sharey=True)

# Create a histogram for each electric vehicle type
for ax, ev_type in zip(axes, ev_types):
    # Filter the data for the current electric vehicle type
    ev_range = data[data['Electric Vehicle Type'] == ev_type]['Electric Range']
    
    # Plot histogram
    ax.hist(ev_range, bins=20, alpha=0.7, color='blue', edgecolor='black')
    ax.set_title(f'Distribution of Electric Vehicle Range for {ev_type}')
    ax.set_ylabel('Frequency')

# Set common x-label
plt.xlabel('Electric Range (miles)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Description of the Figure:
The figure displays multiple histograms, each representing the distribution of electric vehicle range (in miles) for different types of electric vehicles. The x-axis indicates the electric range in miles, while the y-axis shows the frequency of vehicles that fall into each range category.

Each histogram is labeled with the corresponding electric vehicle typeâ€”such as Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV). By visual comparison, one can observe how the electric range varies across the different types of electric vehicles. The overall distribution helps identify patterns, such as the most common ranges for various vehicle types and any noticeable peaks or gaps in electric range availability.
