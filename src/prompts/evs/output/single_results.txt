To achieve your goal of visualizing the distribution of electric vehicle ranges for each type of electric vehicle, we will use Python's `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` for plotting. Below is a script that will generate side-by-side histograms for the electric range of various electric vehicle types based on the provided data.

Make sure to install the required libraries if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

Here's the Python script:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('./data/evs.csv')

# Set the plot style
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Create a figure with subplots
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Extract unique electric vehicle types
ev_types = data['Electric Vehicle Type'].unique()

# Create subplots for each electric vehicle type
for i, ev_type in enumerate(ev_types):
    plt.subplot(1, len(ev_types), i + 1)
    subset = data[data['Electric Vehicle Type'] == ev_type]
    plt.hist(subset['Electric Range'], bins=20, color='blue', alpha=0.7)
    plt.title(ev_type)
    plt.xlabel('Electric Range (miles)')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')

# Set overall title and layout
plt.suptitle('Distribution of Electric Vehicle Range by Type')
plt.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.95])
plt.show()
```

### Description of the Figure

The generated figure contains side-by-side histograms for the electric range of different types of electric vehicles (EVs) present in the dataset. Each subplot corresponds to a unique electric vehicle type, such as "Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)" or "Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)". The x-axis of each histogram represents the electric vehicle range in miles, while the y-axis indicates the frequency of vehicles within each range interval.

This visualization provides insights into the distribution of electric vehicle ranges across different types of EVs, allowing for easy comparison of their ranges and highlighting the variability in electric ranges within each category.
