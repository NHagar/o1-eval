    "content": "The following Python script will load the dataset, preprocess it to filter out any incomplete data, and generate histograms showing the distribution of electric vehicle range for each electric vehicle type. The histograms will be displayed side by side for easy comparison.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load data\nfile_path = './data/evs.csv'\ndata = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n\n# Preprocess: Filter out NaNs in Electric Range and Electric Vehicle Type\nfiltered_data = data.dropna(subset=['Electric Range', 'Electric Vehicle Type'])\n\n# Group by Electric Vehicle Type\nvehicle_types = filtered_data['Electric Vehicle Type'].unique()\n\n# Set up subplots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=len(vehicle_types), figsize=(15, 5))\n\n# Create histograms for each vehicle type\nfor ax, vehicle_type in zip(axes, vehicle_types):\n    subset = filtered_data[filtered_data['Electric Vehicle Type'] == vehicle_type]\n    ax.hist(subset['Electric Range'], bins=20, alpha=0.7, color='blue')\n    ax.set_title(vehicle_type)\n    ax.set_xlabel('Electric Range (miles)')\n    ax.set_ylabel('Frequency')\n\nplt.tight_layout()  # Adjust layout\nplt.suptitle('Distribution of Electric Vehicle Range by Type', y=1.05)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis script will produce side-by-side histograms for each of the electric vehicle types present in the dataset. The figure will illustrate how the range varies among different electric vehicle types, helping to identify the most and least efficient options available. Each histogram is labeled accordingly for clarity.",
