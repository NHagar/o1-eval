To generate a figure showing the distribution of electric vehicle range by type, I'll follow these steps:
1. Import necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization.
2. Load the dataset from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Filter the DataFrame to ensure there are no missing values in the 'Electric Vehicle Type' and 'Electric Range' columns.
4. Use seaborn or matplotlib to create histograms for each electric vehicle type.
5. Ensure that histograms are displayed side by side for easy comparison.

I will use the DataFrame to group the data based on 'Electric Vehicle Type' and then plot the 'Electric Range' for each type in separate histograms.

Next, I need to finalize the plotting settings to ensure clarity and add titles and labels to the axes to make the figure informative.

I'll write the complete Python script to perform these operations.

I have laid out a clear plan to achieve the objective of generating the required figure. I will ensure that the script takes care of handling potential issues with missing data and create a figure that is well-labeled so that the information can be easily interpreted. I'll briefly describe the output created by the script after preparing it.

It might also be beneficial to ensure the figure has a consistent color scheme and shared axes to improve clarity. I should verify that the paths and columns used for filtering and plotting match the example data effectively.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('./data/evs.csv')

# Filter out rows with missing values in 'Electric Vehicle Type' or 'Electric Range'
df_filtered = df[['Electric Vehicle Type', 'Electric Range']].dropna()

# Set up the matplotlib figure for histograms
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Create a histogram for each electric vehicle type
sns.histplot(data=df_filtered, x='Electric Range', hue='Electric Vehicle Type', multiple='stack', bins=30, kde=True)

# Adding titles and labels
plt.title('Distribution of Electric Vehicle Range by Type')
plt.xlabel('Electric Range (miles)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.xlim(0, df_filtered['Electric Range'].max() + 20)  # Limiting x-axis for better visibility
plt.legend(title='Electric Vehicle Type')
plt.grid(True)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

### Figure Description:
The generated figure displays the distribution of electric vehicle range (in miles) for different types of electric vehicles. Each electric vehicle type is represented by a distinct color within the histogram. The x-axis represents the electric range, and the y-axis shows the frequency of vehicles within given range bins. A Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) line is added to visualize the distribution more smoothly across the range. The color-coded legend aids in distinguishing between the various electric vehicle types.
