Import necessary libraries: pandas and matplotlib.pyplot.
Read the evs.csv file into a DataFrame using pandas' read_csv function.
Filter the data to include only rows where Electric Vehicle Type is not missing (NaN) and convert it to a categorical variable for histogram purposes.
Melt the remaining DataFrame along 'Electric Vehicle Type' to reshape the data into individual records, one per vehicle type.
Group the melted data by 'Electric Vehicle Type' and calculate the mean of 'Electric Range' as the x-values for each histogram.
Create a figure with multiple subplots using matplotlib's subplot function.
For each unique electric vehicle type, create a separate histogram on the same plot, using the calculated mean electric range values as x-values.
Display the figure.

First, we need to load the necessary libraries and read the CSV file into a DataFrame:
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

ev_df = pd.read_csv('./data/evs.csv')
```
Next, filter out rows where Electric Vehicle Type is missing (NaN) and convert it to a categorical variable for histogram purposes:

```python
# Filter out missing values in 'Electric Vehicle Type'
ev_df = ev_df.dropna(subset=['Electric Vehicle Type'])

# Convert 'Electric Vehicle Type' to categorical for histograms
ev_df['Electric Vehicle Type'] = pd.Categorical(ev_df['Electric Vehicle Type'])
```

Melt the remaining DataFrame along 'Electric Vehicle Type':

```python
# Melt the data along 'Electric Vehicle Type'
melted_ev_df = pd.melt(ev_df, id_vars=['Electric Range'], value_vars=['Electric Vehicle Type'])
```
Group the melted data by 'Electric Vehicle Type' and calculate the mean of 'Electric Range':

```python
# Group the melted data by 'Electric Vehicle Type' and take the mean of 'Electric Range'
grouped_ev_df = melted_ev_df.groupby('variable')['value'].mean().reset_index()
```

Now we need to create a figure with multiple subplots using matplotlib's subplot function, where each electric vehicle type gets its own histogram on the same plot:

```python
# Create a figure with multiple subplots for different EV types
fig, axs = plt.subplots(len(grouped_ev_df), figsize=(8, 6 * len(grouped_ev_df)))

for i, ev_type in enumerate(grouped_ev_df['variable']):
    # Get data specifically for current electric vehicle type
    specific_ev_data = melted_ev_df[melted_ev_df['variable'] == ev_type]

    # Create a histogram for the current EV type on its corresponding subplot
    axs[i].hist(specific_ev_data['value'], bins=range(0, int(max(melted_ev_df['value'])) + 50, 50), alpha=0.7)

# Set labels and title for all subplots
for ax in axs:
    ax.set_xlabel('Electric Range (miles)')
    ax.set_ylabel('Count')
plt.suptitle('Distribution of Electric Vehicle Range by Type')

# Layout so plots do not overlap
fig.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.95])
```
This code creates a figure with multiple subplots, where each subplot displays the histogram for a different electric vehicle type.

Now we can execute this thinking step-by-step to get our desired output: 

<pl>
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load libraries and read csv into DataFrame
ev_df = pd.read_csv('./data/evs.csv')

# Filter out missing values in 'Electric Vehicle Type'
ev_df = ev_df.dropna(subset=['Electric Vehicle Type'])

# Convert 'Electric Vehicle Type' to categorical for histograms
ev_df['Electric Vehicle Type'] = pd.Categorical(ev_df['Electric Vehicle Type'])

# Melt the data along 'Electric Vehicle Type'
melted_ev_df = pd.melt(ev_df, id_vars=['Electric Range'], value_vars=['Electric Vehicle Type'])

# Group the melted data by 'Electric Vehicle Type' and take the mean of 'Electric Range'
grouped_ev_df = melted_ev_df.groupby('variable')['value'].mean().reset_index()

# Create a figure with multiple subplots for different EV types
fig, axs = plt.subplots(len(grouped_ev_df), figsize=(8, 6 * len(grouped_ev_df)))

for i, ev_type in enumerate(grouped_ev_df['variable']):
    # Get data specifically for current electric vehicle type
    specific_ev_data = melted_ev_df[melted_ev_df['variable'] == ev_type]

    # Create a histogram for the current EV type on its corresponding subplot
    axs[i].hist(specific_ev_data['value'], bins=range(0, int(max(melted_ev_df['value'])) + 50, 50), alpha=0.7)

# Set labels and title for all subplots
for ax in axs:
    ax.set_xlabel('Electric Range (miles)')
    ax.set_ylabel('Count')
plt.suptitle('Distribution of Electric Vehicle Range by Type')

# Layout so plots do not overlap
fig.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.95])

plt.show()
```

This will display the distribution of electric vehicle range for each type in a histogram format.
