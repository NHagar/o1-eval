Here is the Python script that generates the figure:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data from CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('./data/evs.csv')

# Define a dictionary to group electric vehicle types by color
colors = {
    'Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)': 'blue',
    'Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)': 'red',
}

# Create a figure with multiple subplots for each electric vehicle type
fig, axs = plt.subplots(len(colors), figsize=(8, 6 * len(colors)))

# Iterate over each electric vehicle type
for i, ev_type in enumerate(colors):
    # Filter the data by electric vehicle type
    ev_df = df[df['Electric Vehicle Type'] == ev_type]
    
    # Plot a histogram of electric range for this type
    axs[i].hist(ev_df['Electric Range'], bins=20, alpha=0.7, color=colors[ev_type], edgecolor='black')
    axs[i].set_title(f'{ev_type} Electric Vehicles - Electric Range Distribution')
    axs[i].set_xlabel('Range (miles)')
    axs[i].set_ylabel('Frequency')

# Layout so plots do not overlap
fig.tight_layout()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

This script first loads the data from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. Then, it defines a dictionary to map electric vehicle types to colors for plotting.

Next, it creates a figure with multiple subplots using `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots()`. The number of subplots is determined by the number of keys in the `colors` dictionary (i.e., the number of electric vehicle types).

The script then iterates over each electric vehicle type. For each type, it filters the data to include only rows where the 'Electric Vehicle Type' column matches the current type.

Finally, it plots a histogram of the 'Electric Range' column for this type using `matplotlib.pyplot.hist()`. The resulting histograms are displayed side by side in the figure.

When you run this script, it will display the distribution of electric vehicle ranges for each electric vehicle type. Each histogram represents the range (in miles) of vehicles within that category, and the x-axis represents the range values while the y-axis shows how frequently a certain value occurs.

The plot is informative as it gives an idea about how the electric range varies among different types of electric vehicles.
