Below is a complete Python script that combines all the steps required to load, clean, analyze, and visualize the distribution of electric vehicle range for each electric vehicle type. Make sure to adjust the file path as necessary to point to your dataset.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Step 1: Load the Data
file_path = './data/evs.csv'  # Adjust the path to your data file
ev_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Step 2: Inspect the Data
print("Dataset Head:")
print(ev_data.head())
print("\nDataset Info:")
print(ev_data.info())
print("\nMissing Values:")
print(ev_data.isnull().sum())

# Step 3: Clean the Data
# Remove rows with missing values in 'Electric Range' or 'Electric Vehicle Type'
ev_data_cleaned = ev_data.dropna(subset=['Electric Range', 'Electric Vehicle Type'])

# Strip whitespace and normalize electric vehicle type
ev_data_cleaned['Electric Vehicle Type'] = ev_data_cleaned['Electric Vehicle Type'].str.strip()

# Step 4: Analyze Distribution
descriptive_stats = ev_data_cleaned.groupby('Electric Vehicle Type')['Electric Range'].describe()
print("\nDescriptive Statistics of Electric Range by Vehicle Type:")
print(descriptive_stats)

# Step 5: Visualize the Distribution of Electric Range for Each Electric Vehicle Type
# Get unique electric vehicle types
vehicle_types = ev_data_cleaned['Electric Vehicle Type'].unique()

# Create histograms for each electric vehicle type
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))

# Create subplots for each vehicle type
for i, vehicle_type in enumerate(vehicle_types):
    plt.subplot(len(vehicle_types), 1, i + 1)  # Separate row for each type
    sns.histplot(ev_data_cleaned[ev_data_cleaned['Electric Vehicle Type'] == vehicle_type]['Electric Range'],
                 bins=20, kde=True)  # kde=True adds a kernel density estimate
    plt.title(f'Distribution of Electric Range for {vehicle_type}')
    plt.xlabel('Electric Range (miles)')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### How to Run the Script:
1. Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

2. Save the code above in a Python file, for example, `analyze_ev_range.py`.

3. Make sure the dataset `evs.csv` is located at `./data/` relative to where you run the script. Adjust the `file_path` variable if necessary.

4. Execute the script in your Python environment:

```bash
python analyze_ev_range.py
```

### What the Script Does:
- **Loads the Data**: Reads data from the specified CSV file using pandas.
- **Inspects the Data**: Displays the first few rows, info about the dataset, and counts missing values.
- **Cleans the Data**: Removes rows with missing values in the `Electric Range` or `Electric Vehicle Type` columns and normalizes the `Electric Vehicle Type` column.
- **Analyzes the Distribution**: Calculates and prints descriptive statistics of electric range grouped by vehicle type.
- **Visualizes the Distribution**: Creates and displays separate histograms for each electric vehicle type showing their electric range distribution.

This script provides a comprehensive overview of the distribution of electric vehicle range based on the type of vehicle and can be modified as needed for further analysis or as additional data becomes available.
