**Figure Description:**

The figure displays side-by-side histograms illustrating the distribution of electric vehicle range (in miles) for each electric vehicle type recorded in the dataset. Each histogram represents one of the electric vehicle typesâ€”Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV). The x-axis of each histogram indicates the electric range in miles, while the y-axis shows the frequency of vehicles with that range. This visual comparison allows for a clear understanding of how electric ranges vary within and between the different types of electric vehicles.
