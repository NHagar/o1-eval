    "title": "Final Answer - Visualization of Electric Vehicle Range Distribution",
    "content": "The provided Python script successfully generates histograms for the distribution of electric vehicle ranges across different types of electric vehicles. Each histogram presents a visual representation of how the electric range varies for each vehicle type, utilizing seaborn for enhanced aesthetics and offering a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) for a smooth distribution view alongside raw counts. This setup enables a quick comparison across categories, supporting insight into range performance variances in electric vehicles.",
