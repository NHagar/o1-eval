To create a histogram that shows the distribution of electric vehicle range for each electric vehicle type, I need to follow these steps:

1. **Load the data**: I'll use pandas to read the CSV file containing the electric vehicles data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Check for any missing values in the 'Electric Range' or 'Electric Vehicle Type' columns, which could impact the plotting.
3. **Group the data**: I'll group the dataset by 'Electric Vehicle Type' to separate the ranges for each type of vehicle.
4. **Create Histograms**: Using matplotlib, I will plot the distributions as separate histograms side by side for each 'Electric Vehicle Type'.
5. **Customize the plot**: Set appropriate titles, labels, and make sure the layout is visually appealing.

I need to ensure that the histograms are sufficiently clear and distinguishable by using different colors for each type and also label the axes appropriately.

I have covered all necessary steps to create the histogram and identified key considerations like data loading, cleaning, grouping, and the plotting process. I must check to ensure that the histogram displays the ranges properly and make adjustments if the histogram bins overlap or aren't clear enough. I should also consider the scale of the ranges and the number of bins when plotting.

I'll use a reasonable number of bins to ensure that the distribution is understandable without specific values being lost. Finally, I should verify the axis labels and title for clarity.

[No adjustments needed, as the thought process seems solid for generating the script.]

<output>
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('./data/evs.csv')

# Step 2: Data Cleaning
data = data.dropna(subset=['Electric Range', 'Electric Vehicle Type'])

# Step 3: Group the data by Electric Vehicle Type
ev_types = data['Electric Vehicle Type'].unique()

# Step 4: Create Histograms
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))
colors = plt.cm.viridis(range(len(ev_types)))  # Get colors for each type
for i, ev_type in enumerate(ev_types):
    subset = data[data['Electric Vehicle Type'] == ev_type]
    plt.hist(subset['Electric Range'], bins=20, alpha=0.7, label=ev_type, color=colors[i])

# Step 5: Customize the plot
plt.title('Distribution of Electric Vehicle Range by Type')
plt.xlabel('Electric Range (miles)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.legend(title='Electric Vehicle Type')
plt.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.75)
plt.tight_layout()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

This script will generate side-by-side histograms for each electric vehicle type, showing the distribution of electric ranges. Each histogram is color-coded and labeled, providing a clear overview of how electric vehicle ranges compare among different types.
