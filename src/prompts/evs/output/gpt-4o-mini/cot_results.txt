To generate a figure showing the distribution of electric vehicle range (in miles) for each electric vehicle type using the data provided in the CSV file, I will utilize Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries: Pandas for processing the data and Matplotlib for plotting. The following steps will be implemented:

1. **Import necessary libraries**: I'll start with Pandas to read the data and Matplotlib for plotting.
2. **Load the data**: Using Pandas, I'll read the CSV file (`evs.csv`) to get the dataset.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: I'll examine the 'Electric Vehicle Type' and 'Electric Range' columns, ensuring to clean any potential issues, such as missing values.
4. **Create histograms**: Utilizing Matplotlib, I'll plot separate histograms for each electric vehicle type, ensuring they are displayed side by side.
5. **Customize the plot**: Set titles, labels, and legends as necessary to make the figure informative.

Now, I'll formulate the script based on this plan.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('./data/evs.csv')

# Check the relevant columns and drop rows with missing values in those columns
data = data[['Electric Vehicle Type', 'Electric Range']].dropna()

# Group data by Electric Vehicle Type
ev_types = data['Electric Vehicle Type'].unique()

# Setting up the figure for side by side histograms
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))

# Creating histograms
for i, ev_type in enumerate(ev_types):
    plt.subplot(1, len(ev_types), i+1)  # 1 row, n columns
    plt.hist(data[data['Electric Vehicle Type'] == ev_type]['Electric Range'], bins=15, alpha=0.7)
    plt.title(ev_type)
    plt.xlabel('Electric Range (miles)')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.suptitle('Distribution of Electric Vehicle Range by Type', y=1.05)
plt.show()
```

6. **Description of the Figure**: The resulting figure will consist of several histograms arranged side by side, each representing a different type of electric vehicle. The x-axis will show the electric range in miles, while the y-axis indicates the frequency of occurrences of each range within that vehicle type. This visualization provides insight into how the range of electric vehicles varies depending on their type, allowing for comparison at a glance.

The plan and script are logically structured and cover all necessary aspects to create the desired figure. I verified that the script includes data loading, processing, plotting, and labeling steps. It's important to consider the device's memory and processing capability, though it shouldn't be an issue with normal datasets. Lastly, the choice of 15 bins for the histogram seems reasonable to show distribution while avoiding over-segmentation or excessive smoothing. 
Since everything looks good and the logic is clear, I will submit this final answer.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('./data/evs.csv')

# Check the relevant columns and drop rows with missing values in those columns
data = data[['Electric Vehicle Type', 'Electric Range']].dropna()

# Group data by Electric Vehicle Type
ev_types = data['Electric Vehicle Type'].unique()

# Setting up the figure for side by side histograms
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))

# Creating histograms
for i, ev_type in enumerate(ev_types):
    plt.subplot(1, len(ev_types), i+1)  # 1 row, n columns
    plt.hist(data[data['Electric Vehicle Type'] == ev_type]['Electric Range'], bins=15, alpha=0.7)
    plt.title(ev_type)
    plt.xlabel('Electric Range (miles)')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.suptitle('Distribution of Electric Vehicle Range by Type', y=1.05)
plt.show()
```
The resulting figure will include separate histograms for each electric vehicle type, illustrating the distribution of electric range in miles. Each histogram will provide insights into the frequency of different ranges associated with each vehicle type, allowing for a clear visual comparison.
