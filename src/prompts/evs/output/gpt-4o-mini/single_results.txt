To visualize the distribution of electric vehicle ranges for each electric vehicle type using histograms, the following Python script can be used. The script will read the data from the provided CSV file, create separate histograms for each electric vehicle type, and display them side by side.

Here's the Python script:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the data
data_path = './data/evs.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Check the first few rows of the dataframe
print(df.head())

# Set the aesthetic style of the plots
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Create a FacetGrid for the electric vehicle types
g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col="Electric Vehicle Type", col_wrap=3, height=4, sharex=True, sharey=True)

# Map a histogram to each facet
g.map(plt.hist, 'Electric Range', bins=20, color='blue', alpha=0.7)

# Set the title and labels
g.set_titles(col_template="{col_name}")  # Title provides the electric vehicle type
g.set_axis_labels("Electric Range (miles)", "Frequency")  # Axis labels

# Add a main title
plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.85)
g.fig.suptitle('Distribution of Electric Vehicle Range by Vehicle Type', fontsize=16)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

### Brief Description of the Figure

The figure produced by this script is a series of histograms, each representing the distribution of electric vehicle ranges (in miles) for a different electric vehicle type. The histograms are arranged side by side for visual comparison. Each histogram has a consistent format (both axes labeled) while the title of each subplot indicates the type of electric vehicle (e.g., Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), etc.). 

This representation allows observers to easily identify the differences in range distributions based on the type of electric vehicle, highlighting trends, variations, and potential outliers across the different categories.
