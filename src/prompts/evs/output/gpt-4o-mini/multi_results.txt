Here is a complete working Python script that includes loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the distribution of electric vehicle ranges for each electric vehicle type.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Step 1: Load the data
file_path = './data/evs.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Step 2: Inspect the data
print("DataFrame Head:")
print(df.head())
print("\nData Types:")
print(df.dtypes)
print("\nNon-null counts:")
print(df.count())
print("\nSummary Statistics:")
print(df.describe())

# Step 3: Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print("\nMissing Values:")
print(missing_values[missing_values > 0])

# Step 4: Clean the Data
# Drop rows where 'Electric Range' or 'Electric Vehicle Type' are NaN
df_cleaned = df.dropna(subset=['Electric Range', 'Electric Vehicle Type'])

# Ensure 'Electric Range' is of numeric type
df_cleaned['Electric Range'] = pd.to_numeric(df_cleaned['Electric Range'], errors='coerce')

# Drop rows that failed to convert
df_cleaned = df_cleaned.dropna(subset=['Electric Range'])

print("\nCleaned DataFrame Shape:", df_cleaned.shape)
print("\nCleaned DataFrame Head:")
print(df_cleaned.head())

# Step 5: Analyze the distribution of electric vehicle range
# Group by Electric Vehicle Type and calculate summary statistics
summary_stats = df_cleaned.groupby('Electric Vehicle Type')['Electric Range'].describe()
print("\nSummary Statistics of Electric Range by Vehicle Type:")
print(summary_stats)

# Step 6: Visualize the distribution of Electric Range for each Electric Vehicle Type
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))

# Get unique electric vehicle types
electric_vehicle_types = df_cleaned['Electric Vehicle Type'].unique()

# Create a histogram for each electric vehicle type
for i, ev_type in enumerate(electric_vehicle_types):
    plt.subplot(2, (len(electric_vehicle_types) + 1) // 2, i + 1)  # Subplots in 2 rows
    sns.histplot(df_cleaned[df_cleaned['Electric Vehicle Type'] == ev_type]['Electric Range'],
                 bins=20, kde=True)
    plt.title(ev_type)
    plt.xlabel('Electric Range (miles)')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')

# Adjust layout to prevent overlap
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Explanation of Each Section:
1. **Import Libraries**: All necessary libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `seaborn`) are imported at the beginning.
   
2. **Load the Data**: The CSV file containing electric vehicle data is read into a DataFrame.

3. **Data Inspection**: The script prints the first few rows of the DataFrame, data types, non-null counts, and summary statistics to understand the data structure.

4. **Missing Value Check**: It checks for missing values to identify potential issues.

5. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Rows with missing information in critical columns (`Electric Range` and `Electric Vehicle Type`) are dropped.
   - The `Electric Range` column is converted to a numeric type, with errors treated appropriately.
   - Any rows that could not be converted are also dropped.

6. **Data Analysis**: Summary statistics are generated for `Electric Range` grouped by `Electric Vehicle Type`.

7. **Data Visualization**: 
   - A figure is set up for histograms.
   - For each type of electric vehicle, a histogram is created to visualize the distribution of electric ranges with KDE overlays.
   - Titles and labels are added, and the layout is adjusted for clarity.

This script combines all tasks into a coherent analysis that can be executed as a stand-alone file. Make sure to have necessary Python libraries installed in your environment to run this script.
