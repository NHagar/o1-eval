To generate the required figure, I'll need to utilize Python libraries to read the data from the CSV file, aggregate the number of collisions for each borough, and create a geographical map of New York City colored by these numbers.

Steps:
1. Load the necessary libraries: `pandas` for data manipulation and `geopandas` and `matplotlib` for mapping.
2. Read the data from the `collisions.csv` file using `pandas`.
3. Group the data by the `BOROUGH` column and count the collisions for each borough.
4. Load a geographical map of New York City boroughs available in `geopandas` as a GeoDataFrame.
5. Merge the collision counts with this GeoDataFrame.
6. Plot the map using `matplotlib` and color it by the number of collisions.

I'll make sure to check if there are any issues with the data (e.g., missing boroughs) and handle them appropriately.

Let's write a script for these steps:

<reflection>
Before providing the script, I need to ensure that I'm correctly handling the data, specifically any missing or null values in the `BOROUGH` column. Additionally, I must ensure that the geographical data for NYC boroughs is accurate. Using an external dataset from publicly available shapefiles, such as from the NYC OpenData, will help verify this. Keep an eye out for common issues like mismatched data types or format differences when merging datasets.

Let's adjust for any potential errors:
1. Check and drop any rows where `BOROUGH` might be missing.
2. Use a well-known shapefile for NYC boroughs for consistency and accuracy.

Now, I'll provide the script.

```python
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Load collision data
collisions_df = pd.read_csv('./data/collisions.csv')

# Step 2: Ensure we're only dealing with entries that have a borough listed
collisions_df = collisions_df.dropna(subset=['BOROUGH'])

# Step 3: Count the collisions per borough
borough_collisions = collisions_df['BOROUGH'].value_counts().reset_index()
borough_collisions.columns = ['BOROUGH', 'COLLISIONS']

# Step 4: Load NYC borough shapes using geopandas (this requires having a GeoJSON file of NYC boroughs)
nyc_boroughs = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path('nybb'))
nyc_boroughs = nyc_boroughs.to_crs(epsg=4326)  # reprojecting to a common system
nyc_boroughs['BoroName'] = nyc_boroughs['BoroName'].str.upper()  # Match casing on borough names

# Step 5: Merge the collisions data with the GeoDataFrame
nyc_boroughs = nyc_boroughs.merge(borough_collisions, left_on='BoroName', right_on='BOROUGH', how='left')

# Step 6: Plotting the map
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 10))
nyc_boroughs.boundary.plot(ax=ax, linewidth=1)
nyc_boroughs.plot(column='COLLISIONS', ax=ax, legend=True,
                  legend_kwds={'label': "Number of Collisions by Borough",
                               'orientation': "horizontal"})

# Add titles and labels
plt.title('Number of Collisions by Borough in New York City')
plt.xlabel('Longitude')
plt.ylabel('Latitude')

plt.show()
```
<output>
This Python script reads the collisions data from `collisions.csv`, counts the number of collisions per borough, and maps this onto a geographical representation of New York City's boroughs using `geopandas`. The map shows each borough colored according to the number of collisions, providing a visual summary of collision distribution across the city.
