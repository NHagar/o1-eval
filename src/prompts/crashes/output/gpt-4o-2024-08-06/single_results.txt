To visualize the number of collisions in each borough of New York City, we can use the `geopandas` library to map the boroughs and `pandas` to process the data from the CSV file. Below is a Python script that will generate the desired map:

```python
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from shapely.geometry import Polygon

# Load the collision data
collisions_df = pd.read_csv('./data/collisions.csv', encoding='latin1')

# Count the number of collisions in each borough
borough_counts = collisions_df['BOROUGH'].value_counts()

# Load a geospatial file of NYC boroughs
# NYC borough shapefiles might be available as part of datasets like the Natural Earth, NYC Open Data, or similar sources
nyc_boroughs = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path('nybb'))

# Ensure the structure of the borough names is consistent across dataframes
nyc_boroughs['BoroName'] = nyc_boroughs['BoroName'].str.upper()

# Merge the geodataframe with the collision data
nyc_boroughs = nyc_boroughs.set_index('BoroName').join(borough_counts)

# Plotting the map
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 8))
nyc_boroughs.plot(column='BOROUGH', ax=ax, legend=True, cmap='OrRd', legend_kwds={'label': "Number of Collisions", 'orientation': "horizontal"}, missing_kwds={"color": "lightgrey"})
ax.set_title('Number of Collisions in Each NYC Borough', fontsize=14)
ax.set_axis_off()
plt.show()
```

### Description of the Figure:
The figure is a map of New York City boroughs, each colored according to the number of collision incidents recorded in the dataset. The color intensity represents the collision frequency, with darker shades indicating higher numbers of collisions. Areas where data might be missing are shaded in light grey. This visual representation helps identify which boroughs have a higher tendency for traffic incidents, allowing for data-driven insights into potential areas of concern or focus for transportation authorities.
