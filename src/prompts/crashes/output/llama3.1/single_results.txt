Here's a Python script that generates the figure you requested:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('./data/collisions.csv')

# Group by borough and count collisions
borough_counts = df['BOROUGH'].value_counts()

# Create a map of New York City
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 8))
m = Basemap(llcrnrlon=-74.1, llcrnrlat=40.6, urcrnrlon=-72.9, urcrnr-lat=41.2, resolution='l')
m.drawmapboundary(fill_color='#66B3FF')

# Add borough names
boroughs = ['Manhattan', 'Queens', 'The Bronx', 'Staten Island']
x, y = m( -74.05, 40.7), m(-73.9, 41.1)
for i, borough in enumerate(boroughs):
    m.plot(x[i], y[i], marker='o', markersize=10, color='red')
    plt.text(x[i] + 0.01, y[i], borough)

# Add county names
counties = ['New York County', 'Queens County', 'Bronx County']
x, y = m(-74.05, 40.7), m(-73.9, 41.1)
for i, county in enumerate(counties):
    m.plot(x[i], y[i], marker='o', markersize=10, color='green')
    plt.text(x[i] + 0.01, y[i], county)

# Plot boroughs by number of collisions
x, y = m(df['LONGITUDE'].iloc[0], df['LATITUDE'].iloc[0])
borough_counts.plot(kind='bar', ax=ax, x_compat=True)
for i, (borough, count) in enumerate(borough_counts.items()):
    x, y = m(-74.05 + (i % 4)*0.25, 40.7 + (i // 4)*0.25)
    m.plot(x, y, marker='o', markersize=10, color='blue')
    plt.text(x+0.01, y, borough, rotation=45)

plt.title('Number of Collisions by Borough in New York City')
plt.xlabel('Borough')
plt.ylabel('Count')

plt.show()
```

This script will create a map with the number of collisions for each borough in New York City. The map includes the borough names and county names. The boroughs are colored blue according to their respective counts, with Manhattan being at the top left and Staten Island being at the bottom right.

Note that this is just one possible way to display the data. You may want to modify the script to better suit your needs or preferences.
